			"description": "While in bounds and in play, White Blocker initiates an extremely forceful block with a legal blocking zone to a legal target zone on Red Blocker. Red Blocker is knocked airborne, crashes to the track, and remains still until the Jam is called for injury. Red Captain calls an Official Review and requests that White Blocker be expelled for an egregious hit.",
			"outcome": "No penalty.",
			"rationale": "The rules dictate the manner in which Skaters may block and White Blocker met all those standards. A Skater may not be expelled for legal play."

			"title": "Scenario C4.5.B",
			"description": "Red Jammer races to the Penalty Box to serve their penalty. They shout, “I can’t stop!” and crash into the Box. The chairs are knocked backward into a Penalty Box Official. Red Jammer apologizes but complains about how dirty the floor is in front of the Box.",
			"outcome": "Red Jammer is expelled.",
			"rationale": "Unsafe play in respect to Officials, especially those not wearing safety equipment, is held to a different standard than unsafe play in respect to other Skaters. It is incumbent on the Skater to enter the Box in a safe manner, not on the Official to avoid impact.",
			"keepinminds": [
        "If an Official is unable to avoid the impact because of the constraints of the venue, this still represents unsafe play (due to the constraints of the venue). The Skater must be aware of their track environments, including any limitations of space in the Box. Mitigating environmental factors that aren’t expected to be present, such as water on the track, can be taken into consideration when deciding whether to expel the Skater.",
        "Skaters are expected to be in control of themself and their bodies at all times, not just upon entry to the Box. However, opponents, teammates, Team Staff, and Officials in close proximity to the track during active gameplay also bear some responsibility for avoiding contact with Skaters. Contact made to individuals or equipment in areas of active gameplay should only be penalized if the contact is forceful and reasonably avoidable."
